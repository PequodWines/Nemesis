The top ten rows of dry, hill grown oldvine from the cool climate 1971 Dr Edgar Riek vineyard.  2% co-planted Viognier. Contender for the last Canberra Shiraz harvest date before 2021.

Treatment:  Hand picked by the winemaker, driven by tractor 200m from the Lake George vineyard to the Lerida Winery on the next hill.  
Destemmed, 20% saignee, and re-stemmed with very ripe Lerida Vineyard pinot noir stems.   
Whole berries luxuriated nine days on skins, including a two day cold soak, delicate hand and footwork, mechanical cooling to 14-20°, and a brief rest at 24° to rejuvenate the tired yeasts before their final ascent to dryness.

Free run, and gentle pressing from a centrally mounted, R6 Murrumbateman Shiraz filled, 4 tonne bag press.  Racked clean, and 14 months in 1y/o French oak.  Lightly filtered before bottle in 750ml and Magnum glass.

Almost Vegan, fined with potato protein, and 7.5 microlitres per bottle of skim milk.  (0.0001%)
